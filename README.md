# BrowserID::Rails

This gem provides a simple authentication structure to a Rails application
based on Mozilla's BrowserID protocol and Persona service. Users are uniquely
authenticated by email address using public-key cryptography. The advantage of
this is that the rails application does not need to worry about storing or
securing user passwords.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'browserid-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install browserid-rails
